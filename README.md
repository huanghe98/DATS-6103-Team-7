# DATS-6103-Team-7

It just occured to me that regional data could go through some pre-processing, which might be more helpful.
So we could replace the City,State format with just the state or something like West, Midwest, Northeast, etc.
That might make things easier going forward.
It was a thought I just had so I wanted to jot it down and get all your thoughts on it.
